    Privacy Policy for "LiveComments" application (App ID: 1005235576972627)

The app is created for private use only, so, by me. Its purpose is to manage the comments of the live streams I create.
The information of the users that comments are only stored when the live stream is running,
after it finishes no more data is collected, and the current collected data is discarded.
